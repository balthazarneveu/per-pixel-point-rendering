\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In conclusion, the review of this paper has been a great opportunity to dive into the world of neural rendering and understand the challenges of point based rendering.
I have implemented two major topics: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item A script to render calibrated scenes which are ready for neural rendering (with perfect normals, perfect point cloud position and camera poses). 
    \item A pytorch implementation of point projections with the fuzzy depth test (which was satisfying - it allows perfoming live inference)
\end{itemize}
I have pointed out: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item a minor criticism regarding all tricks deployed to model the camera pipeline instead of truly questioning the relevance of benchmarks on the Tanks and Temple dataset. 
    \item a limitation regarding handling view dependent effects which is not a problem in NERF.
\end{itemize}

The amount of work spent by the authors to make their method work very fast on large scale point clouds is tremendous. The crafstmanship of the computer graphics research community is very inspiring.
